# TBH Project

## Overview

The TBH project is a deep learning framework designed for retrieval tasks, utilizing a hashing-based approach. It leverages a ResNet50 backbone for feature extraction and includes custom layers for feature adaptation and binary bottlenecking.

## Directory Structure

- **backup/**: Contains backup files and configurations.
- **schematic/**: Includes schematic representations and diagrams.
- **scripts/**: Contains scripts for training, evaluation, and validation.
  - `eval.py`: Script for evaluating retrieval performance.
  - `validate.py`: Script for validating model performance.
  - `train.py`: Script for training the model.
- **result/**: Stores results and output files.
- **utils/**: Utility functions and modules.
- **config/**: Configuration files for setting hyperparameters and other settings.
- **dataset/**: Data loading and preprocessing scripts.
- **data/**: Raw and processed data files.
- **models/**: Model architecture and layers.
  - `tbh.py`: Implementation of the TBH model.
- **.git/**: Git version control directory.

## Installation

To set up the environment, use the `environment.yml` file to create a conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate tbh
```

## Usage

### Training

To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
bash run_train.sh
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate the model, use:

```bash
bash run_eval.sh
```

## Configuration

The `config/config.py` file contains various hyperparameters and settings, such as:

- `HASH_DIM`: Dimensionality of the hash codes.
- `FEATURE_DIM`: Dimensionality of the feature space.
- `BATCH_SIZE`: Batch size for training.
- `LEARNING_RATE`: Learning rate for the optimizer.

## Model Architecture

The TBH model is built on a ResNet50 backbone, with additional layers for feature adaptation and binary bottlenecking. The architecture is defined in `models/tbh.py`.
